Indie products with a privacy-first approach are making a splash.

Makers and bootstrappers have an edge in this space: they‚Äôre bound to their customers and their users only.

üôÖ No VC üí∏ , small/no investors.

## What large tech is doing to privacy

Large tech companies are profiling users in order to either:

- üí∏ Sell to them more effectively
- üí∞ Sell (services) to third-parties who are interested in that data

Something has to give, your privacy has to have value if companies are spending so much to breach it?

Things are starting to change, all people aren‚Äôt happy with the status quo.

## Challengers to the Google Analytics hegemony

Tackling the Google-opoly in analytics, see:

- üí™ [Matomo](https://matomo.org/ )
- üîñ [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.io) by [@adriaanvrossum](https://twitter.com/adriaanvrossum)
- üïä [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) by [@pjrvs](https://twitter.com/pjrvs) and [@dvkoot](https://twitter.com/dvkoot)

Simple Analytics and Fathom both had super strong launches on ProductHunt (both launching on the same day) as well as HackerNews and Reddit

Here‚Äôs [@adriaanvrossum](https://twitter.com/adriaanvrossum)‚Äôs recap of the launch: [blog.simpleanalytics.io/what-is-wrong-with-developers](https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/what-is-wrong-with-developers)

This shows that something might be changing with developers

We‚Äôve got tools in different categories able to displace larger players by respecting privacy.

## More products taking flight on the privacy-first scene

Ads that don‚Äôt send your data to Google

- [codefund.io](https://codefund.io), [@codefundio](https://twitter.com/codefundio) on Twitter
- [carbonads.net](https://www.carbonads.net), [@carbonads](https://twitter.com/carbonads) by [@BuySellAds](https://twitter.com/BuySellAds)

Another place it makes sense not to feed the data straight to the advertiser is browsers where there are a couple of players

- üîê [brave.com](https://brave.com/) [@brave](https://twitter.com/brave)
- ü¶ä [Firefox Focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/) by [@firefox](https://twitter.com/firefox)

There‚Äôs also the original privacy-first company: [@duckduckgo](https://twitter.com/duckduckgo)

- ü¶Ü [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com/about)

üîé Their search product is what they‚Äôre best known for: [duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com/)

Products are now being branded as privacy-first eg. @pierregillesl‚Äôs Gladys Gateway 

Here‚Äôs a write-up of why that might be: [blog.simpleanalytics.io/why-privacy-first-products-will-make-business-sense](https://blog.simpleanalytics.io/why-privacy-first-products-will-make-business-sense)


> ‚û°Ô∏è So I created the Gladys Gateway  
>   
> It's a web UI and a backend accessible from the internet, that routes Gladys commands to your house.  
>   
> üîê But as Gladys is a privacy-first product, all this product is end-to-end encrypted

Let us know what you think of your user's privacy vs ease of use/feature set

Is the depth of data Google collects worth the risk to your users?

Does it ever bother you how much Google et al. know about you?
