After a successful online hackathon last year with over 4,000 makers taking apart all across the globe. üî•üöÄ. This year [@ProductHunt](https://twitter.com/ProductHunt) decide it will be called Maker Festival.

Making it Maker Festival was to encourage all types of makers, creators and tinkerers to participate and launch a project.
Thanks to [@Abadesi](https://twitter.com/Abadesi) [@rrhoover](https://twitter.com/rrhoover) and the rest of the ProductHunt team.

The event took place over the thanksgiving week with makers building awesome products in select categories.

This year had 6 themes:

* Voice & Audio
* Health & Beauty
* Inclusion
* Brain Stuff
* Remote Workers
* Social Impact

After another successful maker event, the winners were announced on Dec 3.
The winners were shortlisted to 7 and I‚Äôm sure it must have been a tough decision with all the amazing products launched.
