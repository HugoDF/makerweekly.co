No serious, you can productize your services.


## What does productizing a service mean?

It's a way to take what normally would be a one-to-one client service, such as web design, writing and SEO, and packaging them into a more packaged service. 

A PRODUCT, BOOM 💥!!

Productizing a service is relatively new, in fact it’s one of the easiest way to start a product or MVP.

Makers and non-makers alike can easily launch their products now on per. You don’t need to have all the technical skill to be a maker. You are a writer? You can start

“Writing” as a service. There, a new product just launched.
