A great one to get people off their couch and onto [@shipstreams](https://twitter.com/@shipstreams) is the "24 hour startup" challenge

It's an idea from [@thepatwalls](https://twitter.com/thepatwalls) following the success of his two 24-hour projects: "You don't need WordPress" and "Clout Report".


> There are 300+ ðŸ˜³ people who are already signed up.  
>   
> The first event is this weekend [17 November 2018](https://24hrstartup.com)
> 
> You can see the latest participant list at: [24hrstartup](https://24hrstartup.com/participants)

As an effect of the success this challenge is having, we've once again seen people come out and speak against the use of "startup" for something built in a short time span

Here's what we have to say to them
