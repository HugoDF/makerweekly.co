What a weekend celebrating makers looks like.

## Start at the end, so many launches

Let's start with a crazy view of what [@ProductHunt](https://twitter.com/ProductHunt) looked like on Sunday after 24hrstartup

## Product Variety

Over the following days the 24hr startup crew had more than their fair share of launches

Lots of variety: web, bots, extensions and even native apps

eg. @jordibruin with DrawRun

## Stat attack 📊

Of course, we have to give you some search and data magic numbers

Here's what I ([@hugo__df](https://twitter.com/hugo__df)) used to search for the maximum number of signups to be announced:

[https://twitter.com/search?q=%2324hrstartup%20400](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/drawrun )

The magic number looks like 4 x 💯(400).

The stats:

- ✍️ 400 people signed up
- 👩‍💻 167 people streamed
- 🛫 94 products launched

In other words

- 🙋‍♀️ 42% showed up (50+% no-show)
- 🚢 of those 56% shipped
- 🛤 overall 23% converted from signup -> ship

That's amazing!

All thanks to massive amounts of hard work from the whole team
