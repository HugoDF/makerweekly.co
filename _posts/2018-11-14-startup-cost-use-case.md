A project doing wonders in the "don't worry, just do" space is [@startupcosts](https://twitter.com/startupcosts)

The startup directory is growing fast, they hit 250 in November and now they're gunning for 500.

> Beyond excited that, last weekend, the 250th Startup signed up and tracked their expenses on Startup Costs. 2\. 5\. 0\.

## What's the use-case for seeing other startups'/projects' costs?

They help you understand how much it's ok to spend on running your project.

There are 2 key aspects to what they're doing
1. Being transparent helps you be honest with how many costs you accrue which in turns could lead to reducing unnecessary costs

2. It doesn't have to be expensive/engineered to death to work or scale. Keeping track of your costs is crucial to keeping them low and therefore maximising profit.


## Keeping costs in mind

This goes to [@mijustin](https://twitter.com/mijustin)'s points at [justinjackson.ca/costs](https://justinjackson.ca/costs).

It's a case of keeping costs within reason 

## Do it well-enough, most of the time

This thread, where Ethan ([@Booligoosh](https://twitter.com/Booligoosh) from [@KanbanMail](https://twitter.com/KanbanMail)) shares how he runs a 100% profit shop is amazing.

Here's what we can learn:
1. leverages the hell out of your tools, in Ethan's case that's [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/Netlify) and [@Stripe](https://twitter.com/Stripe)
2. do it fast, get it done, worry later
