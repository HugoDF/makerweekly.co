The success of the "24 hour startup" challenge is not about startups.

## A controversial approach

The concept isn't new, students (and non-students) have been running time-limited coding/product creation events for a while.

The same arguments always crop up:

- This isn't a *insert name of type of event* (eg. startup)
- It's not meaningful to build in X amount of time
- Using the term X isn't accurate

There are always two sides to the story and both sides tend to have a point.

## Undeniable benefits

Getting someone get their first taste of building something isn't to be scoffed at though.

One of the reads we recommend on the topic is [@jessem](https://twitter.com/jessem)'s piece

It's longer-form than a tweet or back-and-forth on Reddit/Hacker News which means he can actually make a nuanced point.

Read it: [It's not a startup: The evolving definition in a 24-hour, live-streamed, bootstrapped world](https://www.indiehackers.com/@jessems/acb03ba9fe)

These are the points we want to re-iterate:

- Constraint breeds creativity
- Shipping helps in ways you don't expect
- Empowering people to think they can achieve is the start of the journey

## Benefits of promotion vs potential for backlash

Of course this could have been called a "24 hour product challenge".

Would [@thepatwalls](https://twitter.com/thepatwalls) have done so well without the "startup" in his two 24 hour startups?

This ends up boiling down to promotion vs the backlash from an entrenched community

## "Startup": stretching meaning

Stretching the meaning of a word so that hundreds of people feel the impetus to do something that's out of their comfort zone likely outweighs some backlash from Reddit/Hacker News types

Nevertheless, in the world of Indie Makers and solopreneurs.

Where self-funding, bootstrapping and keeping costs low to maximise profit are core beliefs.

Does it make sense to use a term usually associated with funding and growth over profit?

No matter what you think, it seems to have worked.

Hundreds of individuals in the space contributed and used this as an opportunity to go beyond what they do in their day to day.

Great work [@thepatwalls](https://twitter.com/thepatwalls) and the entire team of #24hrstartup
